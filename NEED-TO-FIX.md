### NEED TO FIX

- If you destroy 2 slabs above each-other just one random item will be dropped. - 2 Slabs --> 1 Random Item

- SAPLINGS and STICKS drop from TREES due to the natural disappearing of the trees

- NEED TO FIX CHORUS-FRUIT _ TREES

- Sometimes still Sugarcane for example (I saw it there) still gets destroyed and drops sugarcane with water.
