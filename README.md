### NEED TO FIX
- KELP, BAMBOO, CACTUS, SUGARCANE breaking at the bottom - the other items are not randomized
- Destroying the DragonEgg with a piston or other items - destroying the DragonEgg is not randomized
- If you destroy 2 slabs above each-other just one random item will be dropped. - 2 Slabs --> 1 Random Item
- WHEAT, CARROTS and all other crops drop when harvested with water or being jumped on... same counts for seeds
- SAPLINGS and STICKS drop from TREES due to the natural disappearing of the trees

## TODO
- ADD RANDOMIZED CRAFTING
- ADD RANDOMIZED CHEST-LOOT
- ADD SETTINGS (GUI OR CONFIG) to configure Chest-Loot-, Crafting- and Block-Randomizer.
