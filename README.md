### NEED TO FIX

- If you destroy 2 slabs above each-other just one random item will be dropped. - 2 Slabs --> 1 Random Item

- SAPLINGS and STICKS drop from TREES due to the natural disappearing of the trees

- NEED TO FIX CHORUS-FRUIT _ TREES

- FOUND A BUG AT CRAFTING (if you press a slot which is already full it will get the item of the result and so on, it randomizes the other item... for you)

- Sometimes still Sugarcane for example (I saw it there) still gets destroyed and drops sugarcane with water.

## TODO
- ADD SETTINGS (GUI OR CONFIG) to configure Chest-Loot-, Crafting- and Block-Randomizer.
