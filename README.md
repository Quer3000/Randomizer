### NEED TO FIX
- If you destroy 2 slabs above each-other just one random item will be dropped. - 2 Slabs --> 1 Random Item
- WHEAT, CARROTS and all other crops drop when harvested with water or being jumped on... same counts for seeds
- SAPLINGS and STICKS drop from TREES due to the natural disappearing of the trees
- WATER AND BLOCKS, like seeds...
- Need to test Chorus-fruit trees
- NEED TO FIX KELP BEING DESTROYED WITH A PISTON (DROPS KELP), prob same for CACTUS, BAMBOO, SUGARCANE
## TODO
- ADD SETTINGS (GUI OR CONFIG) to configure Chest-Loot-, Crafting- and Block-Randomizer.
