# TODO: NEED TO FIX CONFIG.yml after /randomizer shuffle
# Randomizer @version@ by querlenker (a fork of motz0815Â´s plugin)
#
#
# Adjusting this value here will not change anything until you reload or restart the server itself.



# The Plugin is activated by default, if you want to deactivate it, use the ingame command "/randomizer stop"

activated: true

# The blacklist is a list of items, that the plugin won't use as randomized items for BLOCKS!

blacklist:
  - MATERIAL.AIR
  - MATERIAL.WATER
  - MATERIAL.LAVA
  - MATERIAL.FIRE
  - MATERIAL.BEDROCK
  - MATERIAL.JIGSAW
  - MATERIAL.COMMAND_BLOCK
  - MATERIAL.STRUCTURE_BLOCK
  - MATERIAL.BARRIER


# SAVING ALL THE RANDOMIZED ITEMS HERE
# Changing this per hand is not recommended, although if you do it correctly, it should work.
# If nothing except "partners:" is in here, you haven't typed the command "/randomizer shuffle" on this server once.

# Here, the random block - item partners are listed

partners:

# Here, the random mob - item partners are listed
